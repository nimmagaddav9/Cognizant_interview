React
---------------------------------------------------
1. Explain the virtual DOM and its benefits in React.
ReactJS is View in MVC.
Virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the real DOM.
React uses virtual DOM to enhance its performance.
 
Difference between virtual dom and real dom?
Suppose line of code is changed , processing is done on particular line.
It will process the whole code in real dom. Virtual DOM is faster.

2. What are hooks in React and how do they improve functional components?

1. React Hooks are inbuilt functions provided by React that allow functional components to useState and lifecycle features.
2. Before Hooks, class components lifecycle methods were used to maintain state in React Applications.
3. To use React hook first we first have to import it from React Library.

//import React, {UseState} from "react":
useState: Manages state in functional components.
useEffect: Manages side effects in functional components.
useContext: Consumes context in functional components.
useReducer: Manage state with a reducer function, For More complex state management.
useRef: Accesses DOM elements or stores mutable values.
useCallback: performance improvement usecase
useMemo: performance improvement usecase.

3. Describe the difference between state and props in React components.

    state                                            
    State is built-in object used to store data that may change over the lifecycle of a component.
    It is managed within the component itself.

    State is mutable. 
    It can be updated using the setState method in class components or the useState hook in functional components.

    State is local to the component and cannot be accessed or modified by child components.

    Props
    Props(properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
    They are read-only and immutable within the child component.

    Props are immutable. Once passed to child component, they cannot be modified by the child.

    Props are passed from parent component to a child component and can be accessed by the child.

Node.js
-------------------------------

4. What is event-driven programming in Node.js?
Event-driven programming in Node.js is a paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by events. 
Instead of a linear sequence of instructions, the program reacts to events, which can be user actions, system notifications, or data availability. 
Node.js is particularly well-suited for event-driven programming due to its asynchronous, non-blocking nature. 

5. Explain the event loop in Node.js and its importance.
The event loop is a crucial mechanism in Node.js that enables it to perform non-blocking I/O operations, 
despite running on a single thread. It continuously monitors the call stack and the event queue. 
When the call stack is empty, the event loop takes the first event from the event queue and pushes it to the call stack for execution. 
This allows Node.js to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently without blocking the main thread.

6. How do you handle asynchronous operations in Node.js?
Node.js provides several mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations, ensuring non-blocking execution and efficient resource utilization. These methods include:
1. Callbacks
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to asynchronous operations. 
They are executed once the operation completes, allowing you to handle the result or any errors.
2. Promises
Promises represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. 
They can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
3. Async/Await
Async/await is a syntactic sugar built on top of promises, making asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code.
4. Event Emitters
Event emitters are objects that allow you to subscribe to and emit events. 
They are useful for handling asynchronous operations where you need to notify multiple listeners when an event occurs.

HTML, CSS, JS, Express.js
------------------------------------------------------------

7. Describe the box model in CSS and its components.

The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding, and the content itself. 

content (the actual text or image within the element), 
padding (space between the content and the border), 
border (a line surrounding the padding), and 
margin (space between the border and other elements on the page)

8. What are closures in JavaScript and how are they useful?
if any inner function holding the outer function data, then such scenario called as closure.

Closures are useful for:

1. Data encapsulation and privacy
2. Maintaining state
3. Partial application and currying
4. Event handlers and callbacks
5. Memoization

9. Explain middleware in Express.js and provide an example of its use.

Middleware in Express.js refers to functions that intercept incoming requests before they reach route handlers. 
These functions have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the chain. 
They can execute code, modify the request or response objects, end the request-response cycle, or pass control to the next middleware. 


express module used to create the rest apis
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD



Additional Important Topics

10. How do you optimize React application performance5?
1. Memoization with useMemo and useCallback:  Use this hooks to memoize values and, reducing unnecessary recalculations.
2. Optimizing Renders with React.Fragment: Use it to avoid unnecessary wrapper elements that could cause additional DOM nodes.
3. Lazy loading with React.lazy: Use it to load components lazily, reducing the intial bundle size and imporving intial loading performance.
4. Code splitting: Employ code splitting to divide your application into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand, improving initial load times.
5. Optimizing Images and Assets:  Compress and optimize images, use responsive images and leverage lazy loading for images to reduce network and rendering overhead.

11. Describe your experience with SQL and database operations in Node.js applications.

1. Mention the databases you’ve worked with:

"Over the years, I’ve worked with various relational databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, in Node.js applications. I’ve used these databases to store and retrieve data for a wide range of applications, from e-commerce platforms to content management systems."

2. Explain how you integrate SQL with Node.js:

"In my Node.js applications, I typically use popular libraries like mysql2, pg, or sequelize (an ORM) to interact with SQL databases. For example, in a recent project, I used the mysql2 library to establish connections with a MySQL database, perform CRUD operations, and handle SQL queries efficiently. In another project, I leveraged Sequelize to abstract some of the complexities and provide a more structured way of defining models and relations."

3. Describe your approach to database operations:

"My approach to SQL operations usually involves starting with well-designed database schemas and using migrations for version control. I work on optimizing queries to ensure good performance, using joins, indexing, and pagination to handle large datasets. For example, I implemented a dynamic search feature using SQL queries that involved multiple joins and conditions based on user input, ensuring the results were returned efficiently."

4. Mention your experience with transactions, error handling, and optimizations:

"I’ve also worked with transactions to ensure data integrity. In one project, I implemented a multi-step process where several database operations had to be completed successfully before committing. I used the BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK SQL statements to handle this. For error handling, I ensure proper catch blocks and handle any SQL exceptions gracefully, logging them for debugging purposes."

5. Show familiarity with SQL query performance optimization:

"In terms of optimization, I’ve utilized indexing to speed up frequent queries and examined query execution plans to identify bottlenecks. For example, in an application with a large dataset of products, I added an index on product categories to speed up filter queries. I also incorporated caching strategies with Redis for queries that didn’t change frequently."

6. Emphasize your testing practices:

"For testing, I use tools like mocha and chai along with mocking libraries like sinon to mock database calls, ensuring that my queries are correctly executed without connecting to a real database during unit tests."



12. Explain the basics of Kafka and its role in microservices architecture.

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that acts as a central messaging system in a microservices architecture, 
enabling loosely coupled communication between different microservices by allowing them to publish and subscribe to "topics" of events,
essentially facilitating asynchronous data exchange without direct service-to-service dependencies,
thus promoting scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility within the system. 

13. What is your approach to unit testing in JavaScript/TypeScript projects?
in react, we will write unit test cases by using 3rd party libraries JEST, Enzyme, Mocha.
//test is the predefined function, used to write the unit testing code

14. Describe your experience with code reviews and best practices you follow.

naming convention is checked. 
Don’t repeat yourself. 
If we can convert the particular logic functional component into new Hook which can reused. 
Ex: Use Screensize hook to check desktop, mobile or tablet.
If the code is company standards or architecture – Containers, components, folder structure has been organized.

Scenario-Based Questions

15. How would you implement a feature that requires real-time updates using React on the frontend and Node.js with Kafka on the backend?

set up a Kafka topic to publish updates, 
a Node.js server acting as a Kafka consumer to receive those updates, 
and then use a WebSocket connection to push those updates to the React frontend in real-time;


16. Describe your process for sizing and estimating user stories in an Agile development environment.

In an agile environment, I rely heavily on collaboration and communication with my team. 
I participate in daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives to ensure everyone is aligned.
When prioritizing tasks, I focus on business needs and user impact. I break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and 
ensure that I am regularly delivering incremental value. I also leverage tools like Jira to track progress and manage time effectively.

17. How would you refactor a large React component (300-500 lines) into smaller, reusable components?

1. Acknowledge the problem:

"A 300-500 line React component is likely doing too much, which can make it difficult to maintain, test, and understand. It might also lead to performance issues, especially if the component is re-rendering too frequently due to complex state logic or side effects. The first step in refactoring such a component is to recognize that it needs to be broken down into smaller, more focused units, each with a single responsibility."

2. Break down the component’s responsibilities:

"The first step is to thoroughly understand the component's responsibilities. I would analyze the component to identify distinct pieces of functionality or UI sections. For example, is it displaying a form, managing state for multiple inputs, rendering different sections conditionally, or making network requests? Each of these can potentially be refactored into a smaller, independent component."

3. Extract smaller, reusable components:

"I would start by identifying logical sections of the component that can be isolated as separate components. These could include:

UI elements: If there are repeatable elements such as buttons, inputs, cards, or modals, I would extract those into their own components.
Sections of the page: For example, a large form might have individual form fields that can be broken out into smaller, reusable components (e.g., TextInput, Checkbox, SubmitButton).
State management: If the component manages multiple pieces of state (e.g., form values, validation errors), I might create separate components to handle different sections of the form or page state, making them more manageable.
Helper functions: Any logic or utility functions like form validation or data manipulation that live within the component can be moved into separate modules or hooks to be reused."

4. Create custom hooks for state or side effects:

"If the large component has complex state management or side effects (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions, or animations), I would consider creating custom hooks. For example:

useForm hook for managing form state and validation.
useFetch hook for fetching data from an API and handling loading or error states.
This helps separate concerns and makes both the component and the hook more reusable."

5. Use Prop-Drilling or Context for Passing Data:

"Once I’ve broken down the large component, I would need to pass the appropriate data and functions to child components. For simple cases, I would pass props directly. However, if the data needs to be shared deeply across many levels of the component tree, I might use React Context to avoid prop drilling and manage state more efficiently at higher levels."

6. Use Composition Over Inheritance:

"Instead of having deeply nested components that require inheritance or tightly coupled logic, I would prefer composition. This means passing child components as props or using children for layout components. This results in more flexible and reusable components."

7. Refactor into Presentational and Container Components (Optional):

"I would also consider separating the presentation logic from the business logic. The presentation components would focus purely on rendering the UI, while the container components would handle data fetching, state management, and logic. This separation makes the code more modular and allows for easier testing."

8. Test and Optimize:

"Once I’ve broken down the large component into smaller pieces, I’d ensure that each smaller component is well-tested, both in isolation (unit tests) and when combined (integration tests). For optimization, I would use React.memo or useMemo for components that are expensive to render or re-render frequently, especially if they receive the same props."

9. Update Component Naming and Structure:

"Finally, I would ensure that each smaller component is clearly named and has a single responsibility. For example, a component for rendering form inputs might be called FormInput, while a component handling button functionality could be SubmitButton. These names make the component's intent clear, improving readability."
